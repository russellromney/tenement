# Roadmap

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for completed work.

## Phase Break Stuff -- Security Hardening (deferred: network namespace isolation)
> After: (none) · Before: Phase Counterfeit

### a. Network namespace isolation (DEFERRED)
- Requires adding `CLONE_NEWNET` to namespace runtime with veth pair setup
- Would break current TCP port proxying model (tenant in new netns unreachable from host)
- Needs design decision: switch to Unix socket communication, or implement full container networking
- Revisit when the single-server story is more mature


## Remaining Work

### File splits (deferred from Phase Full Nelson)
- `hypervisor.rs` at 2730 lines (1400 code + 1300 tests)
- Split hypervisor into: lifecycle, health, routing, deploy
- Split server into: routes, middleware, proxy

### Tenant token middleware wiring
- TenantTokenStore data layer is built
- Auth middleware needs to try tenant tokens after admin token
- Pass tenant_id to handlers for scoped filtering

### OpenTelemetry integration
- Distributed tracing
- Alert webhooks

### Service discovery
- DNS-based service discovery between tenant processes

## Design Principles

1. **Same API, different isolation** -- All levels use the same routing, supervision, and health checks
2. **Fail loudly** -- Clear errors when isolation isn't available
3. **No magic** -- Explicit configuration, no auto-detection
4. **Linux only** -- Production tool for Linux servers
